# Silicon Photonics Toolkit

Various software packages and resources for rapid parameter lookup and calculation have been developed across a range of disciplines [refs]. These resources offer easy and efficient access to standard parameters used in related areas of research. However, numerical simulators and equation solvers are often computationally expensive tools that require significant resources for simple data retrieval and calculations. To address this challenge, we present a Toolkit that offers fast auto-differentiation and data-fetching capabilities. The pre-saved data has been generated through the Lumerical mode-solver and subsequently interpolated and mapped using a state-of-the-art library JAX. The map function from JAX enables rapid runtime for the lookup capability, making it a valuable resource for researchers in the silicon photonic field. Our Toolkit provides a user-friendly interface that enables rapid data access, leading to time-efficient research and accelerated progress in scientific discovery.

## Getting Started

**Silicon Photonics Toolkit** is a toolkit providing fundamental waveguide and material properties to aid in the design of silicon photonic components on SOI platforms with high accuracy and extremely fast runtime. See the [documentation](https://sipkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for tutorials and API reference.

## Installation

### Pip

The package can be installed via pip:

    pip install sipkit

You can install siphotonics with additional packages for developers:

    pip install sipkit[dev]

### Build from source

Alternatively, the package can be built from source by cloning the repository and running the setup script:

    git clone https://github.com/Photonic-Architecture-Laboratories/si-photonics-toolkit.git
    cd si-photonics-toolkit
    pip install -e .

## Dependencies

The package requires the following packages to be installed:

-   [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
-   [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
