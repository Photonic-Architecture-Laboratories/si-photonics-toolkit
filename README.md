# Silicon Photonics Toolkit

## Getting Started

**Silicon Photonics Toolkit** is a toolkit providing fundamental waveguide and material properties to aid in the design of silicon photonic components on SOI platforms with high accuracy and extremely fast runtime. See the [documentation](https://sipkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for tutorials and API reference.

## Installation

### Pip

The package can be installed via pip:

    pip install sipkit

You can install siphotonics with additional packages for developers:

    pip install sipkit[dev]

### Build from source

Alternatively, the package can be built from source by cloning the repository and running the setup script:

    git clone https://github.com/Photonic-Architecture-Laboratories/si-photonics-toolkit.git
    cd si-photonics-toolkit
    pip install -e .

## Dependencies

The package requires the following packages to be installed:

-   [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
-   [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
