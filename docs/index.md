# Getting Started

**SiPhotonics** is a package providing fundamental waveguide and material properties to aid in the design of silicon photonic components on SOI platforms with high accuracy and extremely fast runtime.

## How do I use it?

Just fork the repository and edit away! You can see a live version of this site at [http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html).
